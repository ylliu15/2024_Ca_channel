The pdb file here is an example of the motif with C4 symmetry used to define the framework of the pore.

To generate the helices that form the lining of the pore, the .sh file is an example script to run RFdiffusion.

To generate the channel backbone, the .sh file is an example script to run RFdiffusion to add L residues in each monomer.

To design sequences, the .sh file is an example script to run ProteinMPNN 
The xxx folder contains an example input folder for runnign ProteinMPNN.
